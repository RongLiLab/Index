Welcome to the Rong Li lab GitHub space. 

You can find more about our lab [here](http://research.stowers.org/ronglilab/) and see our publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kUwCxIUAAAAJ&hl=en).

We use GitHub for two purpouses: sharing the code we've developed and for depositing code that was developed specifically for use by our collaborators.
